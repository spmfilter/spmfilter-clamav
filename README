WHAT IS SPMFILTER-CLAMAV?
--------------------------

clamav is a plugin for spmfilter that enables spmfilter to check mails with the Clam AntiVirus 
open source toolkit for viruses. The major goal of this plugin is to provide an easy way for 
virus-scanning emails. If ClamAV detects malicious software like viruses the affected email is 
discarded by the plugin. Optionally notifications can be enabled to inform the recipients and 
sender (configurable) about the discarded message. Activation of the module is done by adding 
clamav to the modules-variable with the [global]-section in spmfilter.conf like follows:

[global]
...
modules=clamav
...

Please note that ClamAV needs to listen on a TCP/IP-socket instead of a local socket to interact 
with the spmfilter clamav-plugin. This is achieved by replacing the option "LocalSocket" with 
"TCPSocket" and "TCPAddr" in clamd.conf as follows:

TCPSocket 3310
TCPAddr 127.0.0.1

Configuration of the spmfilter clamav-plugin is done by adding a new section for clamav to 
spmfilter.conf


[clamav]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 3310
max_scan_size = 2097152
notification = 0
notification_template = /path/to/clamav-template.txt
notification_sender = postmaster@example.com
notification_subject = Virus detected
add_header = true
header_name = X-Spmfilter-Virus-Scanned
scan_direction = 0

If you want to inform your users within templates about which malicious software has been found by 
ClamAV, you can use the '%virus%' expansion which will be replaced by the full name of the virus 
detected. Also there is a '%sender%' expansion which you can use within your templates to inform 
the recipient about the origin sender. If notitifications are enabled, notification_sender and
notification_template are mandatory.
